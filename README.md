- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is the backbone of Airbnb, allowing us to create interactive and dynamic features for the web application. We utilized JavaScript to implement functionality and enhance the user interface.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that provided us with a comprehensive set of utility classes. With Tailwind CSS, we could easily create responsive and visually appealing designs, ensuring a delightful user interface.
